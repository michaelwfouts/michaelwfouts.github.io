									<h1>Engineering Focused Data Scientist</h1>
								</header>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/wvu.png" style="max-width:75px;width:100%" /></span>Michael graduated at the top of his class in Chemical Engineering from West Virginia University in 2017.  During his senior year, he was named a WVU Foundation Outstanding Senior, an award only handed out to the top 1% of the graduating class for the entirety of West Virginia University.</p>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/bhe.png" style="max-width:350px;width:100%" /></span>From June 2017 to July 2021, Michael worked for BHE GT&S (Berkshire Hathaway Energy, Gas Transmission & Storage), formerly Dominion Energy Transmission, Inc., a natural gas transmission company along the east coast.  During his time with the company, Michael worked as a Gas Measurement Engineer performing both capital project and data science work.  Notable projects included working on a Big Data solution towards LAUFG (Lost and Unaccounted For Gas), creating a system to identify and correct data quality issues with test reports, and supporting several field installations.</p>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pierpont.jpg" style="max-width:75px;width:100%" alt="" /></span>For three years, Michael has taught Gas Measurement as an Adjunct Professor in Pierpont Community & Technical College's Petroleum Technology Program to give back knowledge to the next generation of natural gas technical professionals in his home state of West Virginia.</p>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Deloitte Logo.png" style="max-width:300px;width:100%" /></span>Michael worked as a Data Scientist for Deloitte in their Government & Public Services division from July 2021 to August 2022 helping clients with their Data Engineering and Analytics needs.  Michael's primary client was USPS, helping them with their logistics to find opportunities to reduce trips and save tens of millions of dollars.  Michael also created internal POC's for Deloitte including a system that utilized Natural Language Processing to help Deloitte respond to Requests for Proposals and win contracts.</p>
								<p></span>In August 2022, Michael returned to WVU to pursue a Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering with a research focus in using Machine Learning to Model Electrochemical Devices and Systems for Chemical and Energy Conversion. He has made contributions to the Energy Systems & Materials Simulation group at WVU, and is focusing on using Bayesian statistical techniques in the context of reaction kinetics.</p>
